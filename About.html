        <h4>Third Class Superhero (2006)</h4>

Published in 2006, this book spins tales of modern identity and insecurity. A couple is disappointed when they leave their Luxury Car Commercial subdivision for a Life Insurance/Asset Management pitch disguised as an exotic vacation getaway. They are then forced against the limitations of artificial storylines while simultaneously tackling the most terrifying parts of existence. Filled with deadpan humor and originality, Third Class Superhero is an excellent way to mark the debut of an author.

        <h3>Organizations to Combat Anti-Asian Sentiment in the U.S.</h3>

        <h4>Stop AAPI Hate</h4>
        The Stop AAPI Hate coalition was launched in March of 2020 as a response to the rise in xenophobia and bigotry following the COVID-19 Pandemic. AAPI Equity Alliance, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State University all came together for this. The coalition both tracks and responds to incidents involving hate, violence, harassment, discrimination, shunning and child bullying against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Their mission is to “advance equity, justice, and power by dismantling systemic racism and building a multiracial movement to end anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander hate. Along with working to end AAPI hate, the coalition also understands that they must work to end all forms of structural racism.<a href="https://stopaapihate.org/" target="_blank">Click here to help.</a>

        <h4>Very Asian Foundation</h4>
        The Very Asian Foundation works to shine a light on Asian experiences through both advocacy and celebration. They provide support and resources for the expansion of Asian stories and experiences, such as participating in public discussions around Asian issues and collaborating with local and national institutions to place stories front and center. The Foundation also raises funds from a cross-section of individual and corporate donors to provide grants to organizations working within Asian communities.<a href="https://www.veryasianfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Click here to help.</a>

        <h4>Asian American Writers’ Workshop</h4>
        The Asian American Writers’ Workshop was founded in 1991. Since then, they have been dedicated to, not only providing an alternative literary arts space, but also developing and publishing stories told by Asian Americans. They achieve this by, including but not limited to, building an inclusive pipeline, creating a sanctuary space for the imagination, nurturing a new generation of Asian diasporic writers, and taking stories from the margins and pushing them to the center. The AAWW also hosts various writing workshops and has its very own digital magazine, The Margins.<a href="https://aaww.org/" target="_blank">Click here to help.</a>
